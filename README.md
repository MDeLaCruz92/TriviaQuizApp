# TriviaQuizApp
This project is a trivia quiz app that includes questions that are based on the fundamentals of C++ OOP. The user has to answer 4 randomize questions correctly within the time limit or it will count as incorrect, and will move onto the next question. Whenever the user gets the answer correctly, the answer will highlight green and play a correct sound. If the user gets the answer wrong, it will highlight the color blue and play a incorrect sound, but will still show the highlighted green color of the correct answer.
