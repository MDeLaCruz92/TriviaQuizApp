# TriviaQuizApp
This project is a trivia quiz app that includes questions that are based on the fundamentals of C++ OOP. The user has to answer 4 randomize questions correctly within the time limit or it will count as incorrect, and will move onto the next question. Whenever the user gets the answer correctly, the answer will highlight green, and if the user gets the answer wrong, it will highlight the color blue, but will show the highlighted green color of the correct answer.
